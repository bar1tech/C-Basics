Exercise 6 and 7 are combined into this file. 

Exercise 6:

This program prompts for input, and then captures a character
from the keyboard. If EOF is signalled (typically through a
control-D or control-Z character, though not necessarily),
the program prints 0. Otherwise, it prints 1.

NB: In CLion ctrl-D does not work, command-D 
is used but this exits the program immediately.

Exercise 1-7:

Prints the value of EOF

We had to switch our IDE to VSCode editor with integrated terminal in
order to be able to use Ctrl-D to signal EOF.  This simply was not 
working in the CLion IDE console.

We think that VSCode gives us a more basic Unix environment 
as was intended in K & R.
