1.5.2 Character Counting: charcount1_8.c

NOTE 1
What should be the output of this program if we enter the following input ending
with ctrl-D at the CLI: 1 2 3 4 5

The output of this program will be:

```
Enter characters (Ctrl+D to end):

nc = 9
```

**Explanation:**
- The input `1 2 3 4 5` (with spaces between numbers) consists of 9 characters:
    - Five digits: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`
    - Four spaces: the spaces between the numbers
- The program counts every character, including spaces and the newline
  (if you press Enter before Ctrl+D, that newline is also counted).
- If you type `1 2 3 4 5` and then press Enter (which adds a newline), and then Ctrl+D,
  the count will be 10 (because of the newline character).
- If you type `1 2 3 4 5` and then Ctrl+D immediately (without pressing Enter),
  the count will be 9.

So, the output will be either:

```
nc = 9
```
or

```
nc = 10
```

depending on whether you press Enter before Ctrl+D.

NOTE 2
Why does the program skip the `for-loop` when executed?

The program skips the `for-loop` because after the `while-loop`, the input stream (`stdin`)
is already at `end-of-file (EOF)`.  
When you reach `EOF` in the first input (while-loop), the second input (for-loop) immediately
sees EOF and does not execute its body.

**To fix this:**  
You need to clear the EOF condition on `stdin` before reading again, or restart the
program for new input.

**Summary:**
- Once `EOF` is reached, all further input operations return `EOF` until the program ends or
  the `EOF` condition is cleared.

How do we clear the `EOF` condition on stdin?

You can clear the `EOF` condition on `stdin` by calling `clearerr(stdin);` before reading input again.

Hereâ€™s how you can add it to your program:

Add `clearerr(stdin);` before the second input section to clear the EOF flag.

NOTE 3
Is the `;` character really needed in the body of the `for-loop`?

No, the `;` character is not strictly needed as a statement, but it is required by C
syntax when you want an empty loop body.

In your code:
```c
for (n = 0; getchar() != EOF; ++n)
    ;
```
The `;` acts as the loop body, indicating that nothing should be executed inside the loop.
If you remove it, the compiler will expect a statement or block after the `for` and will produce a syntax error.

**Summary:**
- The `;` is needed to indicate an empty loop body.
- If you want to execute statements in the loop, replace the `;` with those statements or
  a block `{ ... }`.

1.5.3 Line Counting: linecount1_8.c

No Notes needed.

exercise1_8.c

     EOF indicates "end of file". A newline (which is what happens when you press enter) isn't the end of a file, 
     it's the end of a line, so a newline doesn't terminate this loop.
     
     The code isn't wrong[*], it just doesn't do what you seem to expect. It reads to the end of the input, 
     but you seem to want to read only to the end of a line.
     
     The value of EOF is -1 because it has to be different from any return value from getchar that is an actual character. 
     So getchar() returns any character value as an unsigned char, converted to int, which will therefore be non-negative.
     
     If you're typing at the terminal and you want to provoke an end-of-file, use CTRL-D (unix-style systems) or CTRL-Z (Windows). 
     Then after all the input has been read, getchar() will return EOF, and hence getchar() != EOF will be false, and the loop will terminate.
     
     [*] well, it has undefined behavior if the input is more than LONG_MAX characters due to integer overflow, 
         but we can probably forgive that in a simple example.
